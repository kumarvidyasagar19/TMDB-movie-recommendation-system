# TMDB Movie Recommendation System
This repository contains the code for a movie recommendation system built using vectorization machine learning techniques. The recommendation system is based on the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The recommendation system utilizes vectorization techniques in machine learning to analyze and understand the relationships between movies and users, enabling personalized and accurate movie recommendations.
